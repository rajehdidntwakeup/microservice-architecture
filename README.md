# RESTful Microservice with Spring Boot, Netflix Eureka, and PostgreSQL

This project implements a RESTful web service using a microservice architecture. The service manages sensor data, including sensor information and measurements. It includes features like persistent storage, a RESTful API, Swagger UI documentation, user account management with different permissions, and a complete microservice setup with an API Gateway, Service Registry, and Config Server.

## Project Structure

The project is a multi-module Maven project with the following structure:

- `microservice-architecture`: The parent project.
- `api-gateway`: The API Gateway for routing requests to the microservices.
- `config-server`: The Config Server for centralized configuration management.
- `eureka-server`: The Eureka Server for service registration and discovery.
- `sensor-service`: The core microservice for managing sensor data.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- PostgreSQL

## Database Setup

1.  **Install and start PostgreSQL.**
2.  **Create a database and user:**

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE sensordb;
    CREATE USER sensoruser WITH PASSWORD 'sensorpassword';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE sensordb TO sensoruser;
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Build the project:**

    Navigate to the project root (`microservice-architecture`) and run:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

2.  **Run the services in the following order:**

    *   **Eureka Server:**

        ```bash
        java -jar eureka-server/target/eureka-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```

    *   **Config Server:**

        ```bash
        java -jar config-server/target/config-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```

    *   **Sensor Service:**

        ```bash
        java -jar sensor-service/target/sensor-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```

    *   **API Gateway:**

        ```bash
        java -jar api-gateway/target/api-gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```

## API Usage

### Authentication

-   **Register a new user:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"user","password":"password"}'
    ```

-   **Authenticate and get a JWT token:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/auth/authenticate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"user","password":"password"}'
    ```

### Sensors

-   **Get all sensors:**

    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/sensors -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"
    ```

-   **Create a new sensor (requires WRITE role):**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/sensors -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" -d '{"name":"Living Room Sensor","location":"Living Room","active":true,"type":"indoor"}'
    ```

### Measurements

-   **Get all measurements:**

    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/measurements -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"
    ```

-   **Create a new measurement (requires WRITE role):**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/measurements -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" -d '{"sensorId":1,"timestamp":"2025-10-22T10:00:00","temperature":25.5,"humidity":60.0}'
    ```

## Swagger UI

Once the `sensor-service` is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

[http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/sensor-service/swagger-ui/index.html)


# Microservice Architecture

This repository contains a sample microservice architecture with the following modules:
- eureka-server
- config-server
- sensor-service
- api-gateway

## Running locally
Ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed. Start services in this order:
1. eureka-server
2. config-server
3. sensor-service
4. api-gateway

## Troubleshooting

- Error: java: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError / com.sun.tools.javac.code.TypeTag :: UNKNOWN
  - Meaning: This happens during compilation when an annotation processor (commonly Lombok) uses internal javac APIs that changed in JDK 21, causing a failure to initialize with TypeTag.UNKNOWN.
  - Fix in this repo: We pin Lombok to a JDKâ€‘21 compatible version (1.18.32) in sensor-service/pom.xml.
  - What you can do if you still see it:
    - Clean and rebuild the project (mvn clean package).
    - Ensure your IDE uses JDK 21 for both project SDK and compiler, and that the Lombok plugin is up to date. Enable annotation processing in IDE settings.
    - If building multi-module, ensure all modules use the same Java version.
